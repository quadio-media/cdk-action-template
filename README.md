# Provision AWS VPC

This action provisions an AWS VPC using the AWS CDK cli. The intention is to encapsulate
the code needed to provision resources. The goal is to avoid conflating microservice application code
with "infrastructure as code". As such all infrastructure code lives in the [aws](aws) package where the
docker entrypoint is `cdk --app aws/app.py $*`

## Inputs

### `subcommand`

**Optional** The aws-cdk subcommand to run. Default `"deploy -f"`.

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: quadio-media/provision-aws-vpc@v1
with:
  subcommand: deploy -f
env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  EXPORT_NAME: CFN_VPC_ID
  STACK_NAME: MyVpc
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
